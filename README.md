# Front-end Starter Kit

This is my very own extremely opinionated front-end starter kit. I'm just putting it out here in case someone finds it helpful in any way. Youâ€™re very welcome to submit issues and contribute if you see anything that needs improvements (I bet there is).

If you would like to see something added to the mix, please feel free to let me know via Twitter: [@nichlaswa](https://twitter.com/nichlaswa)

## Getting Started

### Install all dependencies

`$ bundle install` and `$ npm install`

### Run local development server

Run `$ gulp` to start the server, a new browser window/tab automatically opens on `localhost:3000`

### Folder structure

The only folder you need to think about is the `./src` folder, all your content should go in here.
Make sure you follow the folder structure to ensure that all files get processed in the task runner.

```
